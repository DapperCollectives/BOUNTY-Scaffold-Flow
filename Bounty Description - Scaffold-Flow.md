# Overview
Scaffold-Flow is a resource that is meant to make rapid prototyping of projects on Flow as simple and straightforward as possible. Pulling together a singular collection of repos, resources, and documentation for making it easy to pick up working on Flow projects can help make the ecosystem more welcoming to new developers who are just getting started on their Web3 journey. 

Scaffold-Flow would ideally serve as a one-stop shop for learning about the Flow network, the Cadence programming language, and starting to develop a working knowledge of how to build basic projectsâ€” minting an NFT collection, minting a Fungible Token, creating a simple decentralized exchange, and more.

Without prescribing what specific projects that Scaffold-Flow should feature, a user should be able to accomplish the following:

- Read through the Scaffold-Flow readme.md and be able to easily grasp what kinds of projects they can start to build, where to find the corresponding documentation, and how to get started
- Read along with the corresponding documentation for key projects to guide them through the process of building that particular project to completion
- Additional resources and information on the basics of Cadence and the Flow blockchain 
- These resources can be sourced from third-party sources if there are good, up-to-date examples that can be used
