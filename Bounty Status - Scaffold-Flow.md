# Milestone Phases
1. Product Requirements Documentation and Tech Spec Review + Acceptance
   - Provide a thorough PRD for how the Scaffold-Flow will work and associated technical documentation for how the product will be built. This should include a maintenance plan for the code once deployed.
   - Review the documentation with members of the Dapper Collectives team to collect feedback and ensure the viability of the implementation
   - Due within 10-14 days from assignment of project; teams that do not meet their deadlines will be at risk of having their bounty reassigned
   - 25% of the total bounty reward will be paid upon completion of this milestone

2. Front-End Prototype Review + Acceptance
   - Provide a clickable prototype of the Scaffold-Flow front-end that clearly illustrates the anticipated user flows for a production build
   - Review the front-end prototype with members of the Dapper Collectives team to collect UI/UX feedback
   - Due within 6-10 weeks from assignment of project; teams that do not meet their deadlines will be at risk of having their bounty reassigned
   - 25% of the total bounty reward will be paid upon completion of this milestone

3. Back-End and Smart Contract Review + Acceptance
   - Walk through the technical implementation of the back-end of the Scaffold-Flow
   - Review with members of the Dapper Collectives team to collect feedback and ensure viability of the implementation
