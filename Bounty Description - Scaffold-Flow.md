# Overview
Scaffold-Flow is a resource that is meant to make rapid prototyping of projects on Flow as simple and straightforward as possible. Pulling together a singular collection of repos, resources, and documentation for making it easy to pick up working on Flow projects can help make the ecosystem more welcoming to new developers who are just getting started on their Web3 journey. 

Scaffold-Flow would ideally serve as a one-stop shop for learning about the Flow network, the Cadence programming language, and starting to develop a working knowledge of how to build basic projects— minting an NFT collection, minting a Fungible Token, creating a simple decentralized exchange, and more.

Without prescribing what specific projects that Scaffold-Flow should feature, a user should be able to accomplish the following:

- Read through the Scaffold-Flow readme.md and be able to easily grasp what kinds of projects they can start to build, where to find the corresponding documentation, and how to get started
- Read along with the corresponding documentation for key projects to guide them through the process of building that particular project to completion
- Additional resources and information on the basics of Cadence and the Flow blockchain 
- These resources can be sourced from third-party sources if there are good, up-to-date examples that can be used

# Key Features for Initial Release
Well-organized and maintained Github repo with a variety of projects for users to try, including:
- Create a simple 1-of-1 NFT
- Create a fungible token staking contract
- Create a fungible token
- Create an NFT collection minting site
Well-organized and maintained documentation to help guide users through the specific projects outlined above

# Project Bounty
- $20,000 USD -  to be paid out in equivalent value of $FLOW tokens in 25% installments across each milestone

# Bounty Overview

We’re looking for small teams of experienced engineers and product designers who are excited to build out tools for the Flow ecosystem. Our bounty program favors builders that are interested in working collaboratively with Dapper Collectives to make Web3 more open and accessible to all. Every bounty is broken up into several milestones that allow teams to collect feedback, show progress, and collect milestone payments.

For the Scaffold-Flow project, the milestones are:

1. Product Requirements Documentation and Tech Spec Review + Acceptance
   - Provide a thorough PRD for how the Scaffold-Flow will work and associated technical documentation for how the product will be built. This should include a maintenance plan for the code once deployed.
   - Review the documentation with members of the Dapper Collectives team to collect feedback and ensure the viability of the implementation
   - Due within 10-14 days from assignment of project; teams that do not meet their deadlines will be at risk of having their bounty reassigned
   - 25% of the total bounty reward will be paid upon completion of this milestone

2. Front-End Prototype Review + Acceptance
   - Provide a clickable prototype of the Scaffold-Flow front-end that clearly illustrates the anticipated user flows for a production build
   - Review the front-end prototype with members of the Dapper Collectives team to collect UI/UX feedback
   - Due within 6-10 weeks from assignment of project; teams that do not meet their deadlines will be at risk of having their bounty reassigned
   - 25% of the total bounty reward will be paid upon completion of this milestone

3. Back-End and Smart Contract Review + Acceptance
   - Walk through the technical implementation of the back-end of the Scaffold-Flow
   - Review with members of the Dapper Collectives team to collect feedback and ensure viability of the implementation
   - Due within 6-10 weeks from assignment of project; teams that do not meet their deadlines will be at risk of having their bounty reassigned
   - 25% of the total bounty reward will be paid upon completion of this milestone

4. Production-Grade Build Complete
   - Provide full codebase for the Scaffold-Flow for review by the Dapper Collectives team
   - Due within 4 weeks from assignment of project; teams that do not meet their deadlines will be at risk of having their bounty reassigned
   - 25% of the total bounty reward will be paid upon completion of this milestone
   - Upon reaching Milestone 4, the codebase for the Scaffold-Flow must be turned over to Dapper Collectives for final deployment
